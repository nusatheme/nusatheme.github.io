# Taxonomy Highlight

The **Taxonomy Highlight** block lets you showcase a specific category or tag anywhere on your site. It’s perfect for drawing attention to popular categories or highlighting “top destinations” in a travel blog. You can select a term in the block settings, and the block will automatically display its name and post count.

## How to Add Taxonomy Highlight Block
1. In the WordPress editor, click the **“+” Add Block** button.  
2. Search for **Taxonomy Highlight** and insert it into your page.  
3. By default, the block shows a placeholder.  
4. Use the **block settings panel (right sidebar)** to configure the block:  
   - **Taxonomy Type**   
     Choose between *Category* or *Tag*.  
   - **Select Term**  
     Pick from the list of available categories or tags (depending on your selection above).

## Customizing with InnerBlocks
The Taxonomy Highlight block includes **InnerBlocks**, so you can add any block inside it for a fully custom design.  

**Recommended usage:**  
- **Heading Block** → to display the term name.  
- **Paragraph Block** → to display the post count.  
- **Image Block** → to represent the category visually (e.g., a destination photo).  
- **Button Block** → to link directly to the category archive.  

You can also style the InnerBlocks independently with your own colors, typography, and spacing — without breaking functionality.

The term name and post count are inserted automatically, but you can rearrange or style them as needed.

## Use Cases
- **Top Categories Section**: Showcase your most important categories on the homepage.  
- **Featured Tags**: Highlight specific tags (e.g., “Summer Travel” or “Backpacking”) in a grid layout.  
- **Destination Highlights**: For travel blogs, use multiple Taxonomy Highlight blocks in a grid to display top destinations with images.  

## Best Practices
- Use **multiple blocks together in a grid** to highlight a set of categories or tags.  
- Pair each block with a **featured image** for visual appeal.  
- Keep styling **consistent** (same font size, button style, or image aspect ratio) for a professional look.  
- Use this block in **homepage sections** or **sidebars** to guide visitors to key parts of your site.
