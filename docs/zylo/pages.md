# Page and Post Template
Page templates define the layout and structure of your content on specific pages. For example, they can include or exclude sidebars, headers, or footers to achieve a particular design or functionality. This theme comes with several handy page templates to help you set up your site with ease and style.

## Landing 
A sleek and high-converting landing page template designed to showcase your agency’s services, portfolio, or campaigns with a modern and engaging layout.
## Landing Footer Dark 
A refined landing page template featuring a bold dark footer, perfect for creating a striking visual impact while maintaining a professional and immersive browsing experience.
## Single Post with Sidebar
By default, all single posts are displayed using the sidebar template.

## Single Post Full Width
You can display your single post using the full-width template.

## Page No Title
A clean and simple template that shows only the content without a page title, making it a great option for landing pages or showing multiple sections, such as services, testimonials, or contact forms.

## Page with Sidebar
This template includes a sidebar, similar to the one used in single post templates. Sidebars are typically used for navigation links, recent posts, search bars, or custom widgets like social media feeds. It’s great for pages where you need additional navigation or widgets to complement the main content.
