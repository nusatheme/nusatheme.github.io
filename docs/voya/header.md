# Header

The **Voya** theme includes multiple header template parts that work together to create a flexible and responsive navigation system. Each template part serves a specific purpose, but they all share the same core elements such as the logo and primary navigation.  

These template parts are **not alternatives** to choose from — they are all active and shown depending on device or scroll behavior.

## Header
The **Header** template part is the main site header.  

- Displays at the top of every page by default.  
- Contains your site logo or title, primary navigation, and optional elements such as search icon.  
- This is the header most visitors will see first when landing on your site.

## Header Sticky
The **Header Sticky** template part appears when users scroll back up the page.  

- Ensures that navigation remains visible for better usability on long pages.  
- Uses the same navigation menu as the main Header, so edits made to navigation are reflected here automatically.  
- Can be customized separately

## Header Mobile Navigation
The **Header Mobile Navigation** template part is optimized for smaller screens.  

- Replaces the main header with a mobile-friendly layout when viewed on phones and tablets.  
- Features a toggle (hamburger) button to open and close the menu.  
- Navigation links are synced with the main Header, ensuring consistency across devices.

:::tip
While you can customize each header template part individually in the **Site Editor**, it’s recommended to keep elements such as your logo and navigation consistent so visitors have a seamless experience across desktop, mobile, and sticky states.
