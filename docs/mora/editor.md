### Block Variations

Block variations are versions of standard Wordpress blocks with different attributes or inner blocks. Each variation gives different look or functionality for specific uses, but they're all based on familiar Wordpress blocks like headings or buttons. 

For example, this theme has two heading variations
- Heading Stroke
- Heading Section Title

## Pattern
Block Patterns are pre-designed groups of blocks that you can easily add to your posts and pages, then personalize with your own content. They simplify a combination of many blocks, allowing you to quickly build sections of your site without starting from scratch.

This theme includes predesigned block patterns that contain layouts for common website sections, such as testimonials, portfolio, and call-to-action areas. Instead of manually creating each part of a section—like adding and formatting text, images, and buttons separately—you can insert a ready-made pattern and focus on adjusting only the content and minor design elements.

## Global Styles
In WordPress, global styles are theme-wide design settings that control the appearance of your entire website, including colors, fonts, spacing, and other style elements. With global styles, a wordpress theme creates a unified look, applying consistent design choices across all blocks and elements without requiring custom CSS adjustments. 

By adjusting those settings, you can easily update the overall appearance of your site, while still having the flexibility to make specific customizations where needed.
### Theme Styles
#### Colors
Theme applies a palette of colors throughout the site elements. You can modify each individual color in palette, modify WordPress default color palette, and add your own custom colors.
:::important
**Use solid colors**
As the theme automatically calculates additional colors from its palette, it is recommended to use solid colors, not a semi-transparent ones.

These are available colors

Here’s a selection of available color palettes designed to enhance your visual experience. Each palette serves a unique role, from foundational tones to vibrant accents, allowing you to create a balanced and engaging design.

Here's the available color palletes of this theme. Each pallete serves a unique role, from foundational tones to contrast primary color.

1. **Base Colors** (Base 1, Base 2, Base 3)<br/>
   These colors form the foundational tones for the design. They are often neutral or subtle, providing a balanced background against which other colors (like tints, primary, or contrasts) can stand out. Example Usage: Backgrounds, large content areas, or places where color should not be too visually prominent.

2. **Tint Colors** (Tint 1, Tint 2, Tint 3)<br/>
   Tint colors are lighter versions of the base or primary colors. They are often used to highlight, add depth, or create a soft, less intense look while staying within the same color family. Example Usage: Background or borders in sections that need a softer appearance, or for text elements with lower emphasis.
   
3. **Contrast Colors** (Contrast 1, Contrast 2, Contrast 3)<br/>
   These colors provide the highest contrast to the base and tint colors. They help create focal points and are ideal for drawing attention to important elements. Example Usage: Heading, Title, icons, or other elements where a strong contrast helps visibility and draws attention.

4. **Primary Color**<br/>
   This is the main color associated with the design’s identity and is often used consistently across key areas to establish branding. The primary color is typically bold or distinct, providing a recognizable anchor for the overall color scheme. Example Usage: Brand elements, primary buttons, key UI components, or other visually central elements in the design.
