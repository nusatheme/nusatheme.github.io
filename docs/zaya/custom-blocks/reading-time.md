# Reading Time
The Reading Time block displays an estimated reading time based on the content’s word count, helping readers know how long it will take to read a post or page.


## Key Features
- **Automatic Calculation**: Based on a default speed of 200 words per minute (configurable).
- **Customizable Label**: You can change the text label (e.g., "Min Reading") to suit your site’s tone or language.
- **Front-End Output Only**: The block renders on the front end using a PHP template for accurate server-side calculation.
