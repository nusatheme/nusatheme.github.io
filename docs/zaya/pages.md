# Pages
This theme comes with several handy page templates to help you set up your site with ease and style

## Page Landing
The Page Landing template provides a clean, minimal layout by hiding the page title and focusing entirely on the content. It’s perfect for creating custom landing pages, promotional layouts, or multi-section homepages without distractions.

Use this template when you want full control over the design—like the homepage shown below, which uses the Landing template.

### How to Assign the Landing Template to a Page
To use the Landing template on any page:

1. Go to Pages in your WordPress dashboard and open the page you want to edit.

2. In the right sidebar, scroll to the **Template** section under the Page tab.

3. Click the dropdown and select **Change template** or **swap template**
4. In the modal that appears, choose Landing from the available templates.

5. Click **Save** or **Publish** to apply the changes.
Now your page will use the clean, title-free layout ideal for custom landing designs.

You can view and manage all available templates by going to **Appearance → Editor → Templates**, as shown in the image below.

## Page Pattern
With the latest block theme features in WordPress, creating a page similar to the demo no longer requires uploading demo content. Instead, you can use pre-designed patterns, which are ready-made sections and layouts specifically crafted to match the demo style. 

To build a page like the theme demo, simply go to the Block Inserter, select **Patterns**, and choose from the available layouts to add them to your page. 

You can combine multiple patterns to achieve the exact look you want, then customize text, images, and other settings as needed to fully personalize the design. This approach offers more flexibility and allows you to mix, match, and style your site effortlessly.

### How to Build a Page with Patterns
1. Navigate to **Appearance** → **Editor** → **Pages** in your WordPress dashboard.
2. Create a new page by clicking **Add New**.
3. In the page settings, change the template to **Landing**.
4. Click the + icon to open the block inserter.
5. In the search bar, type **Home**.
6. Select the **Home** pattern from the results.
7. Customize the content as needed to suit your preferences.
