# Pages
This theme comes with several handy page templates to help you set up your site with ease and style

## Page Landing
The Page Landing template provides a clean, minimal layout by hiding the page title and focusing entirely on the content. It’s perfect for creating custom landing pages, promotional layouts, or multi-section homepages without distractions.

Use this template when you want full control over the design—like the homepage shown below, which uses the Landing template.

### How to Assign the Landing Template to a Page
To use the Landing template on any page:

1. Go to Pages in your WordPress dashboard and open the page you want to edit.

2. In the right sidebar, scroll to the **Template** section under the Page tab.

3. Click the dropdown and select **Change template** or **swap template**
4. In the modal that appears, choose Landing from the available templates.

5. Click **Save** or **Publish** to apply the changes.
Now your page will use the clean, title-free layout ideal for custom landing designs.

You can view and manage all available templates by going to **Appearance → Editor → Templates**, as shown in the image below.
