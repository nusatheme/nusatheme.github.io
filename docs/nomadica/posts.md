# Posts
The **Nomadica** theme offers multiple layout options for single blog posts. Each layout is designed to enhance readability while giving your content a unique style. You can select your preferred layout when creating or editing a post.

## Default Single Post
The **Default Single Post** layout is clean and minimal, focusing on the content.

- Right Sidebar.  
- Featured image displayed above the content.  
- Standard post meta: date, author, categories, and tags.  
- Ideal for bloggers who want a classic reading experience.  

## Full Width
The **Full Width** layout removes the sidebar and expands your content to take the full width of the page.
- Content spans edge-to-edge for a modern feel.  
- Featured image displayed full width at the top.  
- Great for visual-heavy posts, travel stories, or guides with large images.  

## Hero Overlay
The **Hero Overlay** layout places the featured image as a **hero banner** at the top of the post. The post title and meta information overlay the image.
- Right Sidebar
- Adds an immersive storytelling effect.  
- Featured image with overlay.  
- Best suited for posts with strong visuals or photography.  

## Hero Split
The **Hero Split** layout splits the header section into two columns:
- Left Sidebar
- **Left side:** featured image.  
- **Right side:** post title, meta, and excerpt.  
- Creates a bold magazine-style presentation.  
- Recommended for feature stories or long-form content.
