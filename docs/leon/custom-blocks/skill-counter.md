# Skill Counter

The Skill Counter block is designed to display a skill name along with a percentage value representing proficiency level. This block is ideal for showcasing skills, such as programming languages or tools, in a visual and engaging way on a portfolio or resume page. For example, you can display "HTML â€“ 80%" to visually represent your expertise in HTML.
