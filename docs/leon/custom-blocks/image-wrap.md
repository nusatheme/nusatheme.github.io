# Image Wrap
The Image Wrap block enables you to showcase images with a distinctive style. Once you upload an image, it is automatically wrapped with a unique border radius, giving it an artistic and dynamic look. Additionally, a decorative circular shape is applied around the image, creating a layered effect that enhances the visual appeal of your content.
