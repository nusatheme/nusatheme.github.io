# Pages

The **Journi** theme comes with several page and site-wide templates that help you control the layout and presentation of your website. Templates determine how different types of content (like posts, archives, and static pages) are displayed. You can use these templates as they are, or customize them in the **Site Editor** to match your needs.

## Site-Wide Templates

These templates apply automatically to certain areas of your site:

### 404
- The **404 template** is displayed when a page or post cannot be found.  
- This is a default WordPress behavior.  
- You can customize this template in the Site Editor to add helpful links, search bars, or messages for lost visitors.  

### Archive
- The **Archive template** is used for listing pages, including categories, tags, authors, and custom taxonomies.  
- Displays a loop of posts belonging to the selected term or author.  
- Ideal for organizing content by topic or contributor.  

### Index
- The **Index template** is the fallback template WordPress uses when no other template is available.  
- Typically displays your blog posts in reverse chronological order.  
- Useful for setting up a blog-style homepage if you don’t use a dedicated page.  

## Page-Specific Templates

These templates are available when creating or editing a page:

### Landing
- A clean, minimal layout that hides the page title and focuses entirely on content.  
- Perfect for homepages, promotional pages, or custom-designed landing pages using block patterns.  

### Landing – Footer 2
- Same as the Landing template but includes the **Footer 2** template part at the bottom.  
- Great if you want a minimal landing page but still display footer content such as links or contact info.  

### Pages (Default)
- The standard page template.  
- Displays the page title and content, with a sidebar.  
- Recommended for static pages like About, Contact, or Services.  

### Page Full Width
- Expands the content across the full width of the page and centers it.  
- Displays a large featured image at the top of the page.  
- Ideal for visually rich pages like portfolios, image galleries, or immersive single-page layouts.  

## How to Assign Page Templates
1. Go to **Pages → Add New** (or edit an existing page).  
2. In the **Page Settings** panel (right sidebar), locate the **Template** dropdown.  
3. Click the dropdown and select **Change template** or **swap template**
4. In the modal that appears, choose a template from the available templates.
4. Publish or update the page to apply the new layout.  

## Best Practices & Tips
- Use **Archive** for category, tag, and author listings so readers can browse by topic.  
- Use **Landing** for homepages or custom promotional layouts.  
- Use **404** to provide a user-friendly “not found” page with navigation options.  
- Use **Default Pages** for standard content like About or Contact.  
- Use **Page Full Width** for highly visual content that benefits from extra space.

✨ **Customization Tip**:  
You can edit any template in the **Site Editor** under **Appearance → Editor → Templates**. If you don’t want to modify the original template, you can **duplicate it and create a new custom template** based on the current one. This is useful if you need slightly different variations without overwriting the defaults.
